# Hi there! üëã I'm Laura Uguccioni

üéì **Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | AI Innovator**

I‚Äôm passionate about the intersection of technology, social science, and ethics. My journey has taken me from academic training in quantitative social science to managing data science teams and diving into hands-on engineering. I'm committed to building socially responsible tools and mentoring future innovators. Recently, I‚Äôve focused on **AI-driven tools for education** and further exploring the **mathematics of model building**.

## üî≠ What I'm Working On

**‚úèÔ∏è [WriteWise](https://huggingface.co/spaces/laurauguc/ai_feedback)** - *LLM Integration & Workflow*  
**WriteWise** is an **AI-powered writing feedback tool** that helps users enhance their written work through tailored, high-quality feedback. It delivers both **high-level insights** and **detailed, downloadable in-document comments** to support meaningful revision.

Users can upload a piece of writing along with relevant **assignment criteria** using flexible input options: **curated rubrics**, **custom uploads**, or the built-in **Universal Writing Assignment Rubric**.

**Advanced settings** allow users to choose a feedback strategy ‚Äî **Glow & Grow**, **Error Spotting**, or **Rubric-Focused** ‚Äî to personalize the experience.



**üåü [GradeMate](https://github.com/laurauguc/grading_assistant)** ‚Äî *App Development*  
GradeMate is an open-source application designed to assist teachers with grading by providing AI-generated recommendations. I developed the backend using Python and Django, while my collaborator, Ksenia, built the React-based frontend. In collaboration with Columbia University's QMSS Innovation Lab, we are working to expand GradeMate as a transparent, contestable, and ethically grounded alternative to many commercial tools. Our aim is to promote responsible innovation in educational technology, especially in contrast to closed-source solutions that sometimes make broad claims about eliminating bias or surpassing human performance.

**ü§ñ [GradeMate with Llama](https://github.com/laurauguc/llama_grading)** ‚Äî *Machine Learning Research*  
This project extends GradeMate, focusing on improving grading accuracy through model fine-tuning. I‚Äôm leading efforts to **fine-tune open-source LLMs** for tasks like scoring, providing justifications, and generating feedback. My work involves implementing fine-tuning and refining orchestration and evaluation processes to ensure reliable, high-quality outputs.
