# Hi there! 👋 I’m Laura Uguccioni  

🎓 **Computational Social Scientist & ML Engineer | Human-Centered AI**

I build and study AI systems as **tools for decision-making, education, and social inquiry**. My background spans **philosophy, economics, and quantitative social science**, and my work sits at the intersection of **machine learning, human judgment, and ethical evaluation**.  

With 8+ years of experience across **research, consulting, and product development**, I’ve led large-scale AI deployments, published peer-reviewed research, and built **generative AI systems that support evidence-based feedback and learning**. I’m especially interested in how **uncertainty, bias, and evaluation shape the real-world use of AI**.

## 🔬 Current Research & Building

**📰 [Who Counts as Working Class?](https://github.com/laurauguc/working_class_media_analysis)** — *Computational Social Science* (2025–Present)  
Large-scale media analysis of how “working class” is represented across **40,000+ articles (1980–2024)** using NLP and generative AI. Conducted in collaboration with a professor at **Columbia University**.

**✏️ [WriteWise](https://huggingface.co/spaces/laurauguc/ai_feedback)** — *Human–AI Evaluation in Education* (2025–Present)  
An **AI-powered formative feedback system** for writing assessment. Uses agentic LLM workflows grounded in **learning science**, with multiple feedback strategies (Glow & Grow, Rubric-Based, Error Spotting).  
→ Actively developing **evaluation pipelines** with **Columbia University practicum students** to measure pedagogical effectiveness and user trust.

**🤖 [Writing Feedback with Llama](https://github.com/laurauguc/llama_grading)** — *Open-Source LLM Fine-Tuning* (2024–Present)  
Research on **fine-tuning open-source LLMs for grading and justification**, focusing on improving **explainability and alignment with human judgment**.
