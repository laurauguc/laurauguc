# Hi there! 👋 I'm Laura Uguccioni

🎓 **Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | AI Innovator**

I’m passionate about the intersection of technology, social science, and ethics. My journey has taken me from academic training in quantitative social science to managing data science teams and diving into hands-on engineering. I'm committed to building socially responsible tools and mentoring future innovators. Recently, I’ve focused on **AI-driven tools for education** and further exploring the **mathematics of model building**.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

**🌟 [GradeMate](https://github.com/laurauguc/grading_assistant)** — *App Development*  
GradeMate is an open-source application that supports teachers with grading by offering AI-generated recommendations. I developed the backend using Python and Django, integrating it with a React frontend built by my collaborator, Ksenia. In partnership with the QMSS Innovation Lab, we're expanding GradeMate as a transparent, contestable, and ethically grounded alternative to the wave of closed-source, for-profit tools that often make unverified claims of “eliminating bias” or achieving “better-than-human” performance.

**🤖 [GradeMate with Llama](https://github.com/laurauguc/llama_grading)** — *Machine Learning Research*  
This project extends GradeMate, focusing on improving grading accuracy through model fine-tuning. I’m leading efforts to **fine-tune open-source LLMs** for tasks like scoring, providing justifications, and generating feedback. My work involves implementing fine-tuning and refining orchestration and evaluation processes to ensure reliable, high-quality outputs.
