# Hi there! 👋 I'm Laura Uguccioni

🎓 **Data Scientist | ML Engineer | Building meaningful, responsible AI tools**

I’m passionate about the intersection of technology, social science, and ethics. My journey has taken me from academic training in philosophy to an advanced degree in quantitative social science to managing data science teams and diving into hands-on engineering. I'm committed to building socially responsible tools and mentoring future innovators. Recently, I’ve focused on **AI-driven tools for education** and further exploring the **mathematics of model building**.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

**📰 [Who Counts as Working Class?: Analysis of Media Representation](https://github.com/laurauguc/working_class_media_analysis)** — *Computational Media Analysis*  
Analyzes how the working class is represented in the media, exploring changes over time and comparing narratives across publishers. Based on **40,000+ articles** published between **June 1, 1980**, and **December 31, 2024**, from *The New York Times* and other major outlets.

**✏️ [WriteWise](https://huggingface.co/spaces/laurauguc/ai_feedback)** — *AI-Powered Writing Feedback*  
An **LLM-based tool** that delivers high-level insights and in-document comments to help users improve their writing. Supports flexible rubric options, custom uploads, and multiple feedback strategies, including **Glow & Grow**, **Error Spotting**, and **Rubric-Focused**.

**🤖 [GradeMate with Llama](https://github.com/laurauguc/llama_grading)** — *Machine Learning Research*  
Extends GradeMate by **fine-tuning open-source LLMs** to improve grading accuracy, justification quality, and feedback generation.

## 🌱 Past Projects and Contributions

- **What LLM Storytelling Tells Us About LLMs**  — *Exploratory Analysis*    
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/laurauguc/llm_stories/tree/main)
  Runs an experiment examining how large language model (LLM) storytelling reveals latent patterns, embedded values, and subtle biases within OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 (April 2025 release).

- **🌟 GradeMate** — *App Development*    
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/laurauguc/grading_assistant)
  GradeMate was an initial exploration into using AI for evaluation, allowing us to build an MVP and gather educator feedback. I developed the Python/Django backend, while my collaborator, Ksenia, built the React frontend. The project later evolved into **The Feedback Desk**, developed with Columbia University’s QMSS Innovation Lab to advance transparent and ethical AI in education.

- **Cross-Voting Election Patterns**  — *Data Visualization*    
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/laurauguc/cross-voting)
  Interactive Python and Leaflet visualization analyzing cross-voting in Mexico’s landmark 2024 elections—marked by the first female presidential victory and record margin—revealing how Sonora voters backed Morena nationally but favored a PAN candidate locally.

- **Bayesian Time Series Analysis with Stan**  — *Mathematical Modeling*    
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/laurauguc/bayesian_time_series)
  Implementation of a Bayesian ARIMA model in Stan, with visualization of uncertainty propagation through posterior sampling and comparison of results to a frequentist approach to highlight theoretical and practical differences in time-series forecasting.

- **A Human-Machine Collaboration to Avoid Wrongful Incarceration**  — *Text Processing*    
  [TEDx Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/laura_uguccioni_a_human_machine_collaboration_to_avoid_wrongful_incarceration?subtitle=en&geo=es)

- **Twitter Sentiment in New York City Parks as a Measure of Well-Being**  — *Applied Machine Learning*    
  [ScienceDirect Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204618305863)
  *Published in* **Landscape and Urban Planning, 189**, 235–246. A peer-reviewed study analyzing approximately **3.3 million geolocated tweets** (June 2016 – December 2017) to compare sentiment expressed inside and outside New York City parks. Findings show that while park tweets in   **Manhattan** were slightly less positive, those from parks in **Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx** were significantly more positive.  
  The study demonstrates how **social-media sentiment analysis** can serve as a proxy for **urban well-being**, offering insights for **urban design and public-space planning**.
