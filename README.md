# Hi there! üëã I'm Laura Uguccioni

üéì **Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | AI Innovator**

I'm a data scientist specializing in **NLP, statistics, and machine learning**. My journey has taken me from academic training in quantitative social science to managing data science teams and diving into hands-on engineering. I'm passionate about building AI tools and mentoring future innovators. Recently, I‚Äôve focused on **AI-driven tools for education** and further exploring the **mathematics of model building**.

## üîç What I'm Working On

**üåü [GradeMate](https://github.com/laurauguc/grading_assistant)**  
An AI-powered app designed to assist teachers with grading by providing insightful recommendations. I‚Äôm developing a **freemium model** that offers a free basic tier for individual educators and a premium version for schools, complete with enhanced features and integrations.

**ü§ñ [GradeMate with Llama](https://github.com/laurauguc/llama_grading)**  
This project extends GradeMate, focusing on improving grading accuracy through model fine-tuning. I‚Äôm leading efforts to **fine-tune open-source LLMs** for tasks like scoring, providing justifications, and generating feedback. My work involves implementing fine-tuning and refining orchestration and evaluation processes to ensure reliable, high-quality outputs.

- **Indebted to Work: Bondage in Brick Kilns**  
  [Springer Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-349-95957-0_19)  
  *Abstract:* This research explores the practice of giving advances to rural migrants in exchange for work in brick production, often keeping them away from home for over six months each year. The study examines exploitative labor practices, lack of legal protections, and the factors that sustain these 'neo-bondage' conditions, including the role of contractor chains and lack of prosecution under bonded labor laws. Recommendations include enhancing social protection access, deploying technology to break exploitation cycles, and promoting skill development for workers.

- **Using a Glacier Website to Promote Action and Build Community**  
  [JStore Link](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvjnrw0q)
  *Contributed Chapter 12 in the book:* *Climate, Capitalism, and Communities: An Anthropology of Environmental Overheating*  
  This chapter discusses how the website GlacierHub has become a platform for "engaged anthropology," addressing interconnected environmental and economic crises. Established in 2014, GlacierHub exemplifies an engaged approach to anthropology, aiming to promote awareness and community action in response to climate challenges. The discussion aligns with broader definitions of engaged anthropology as active practice rather than solely research-driven (Low and Merry, 2010).

- **Research on Food Deserts**  
  [Project Report](https://github.com/laurauguc/Food-Deserts-in-Mississippi/blob/master/Food%20Deserts%20-%20Final%20Project.pdf)  
  Conducted for GIS and Spatial Analysis work, this project analyzed the association between food deserts and health outcomes such as diabetes and obesity. Food deserts were identified as census tracts lacking proximity to produce outlets. A county-level measure of food deserts was developed, followed by a spatial regression analysis on health outcomes, controlling for age and household income. Key tools included R and GeoDa for statistical analysis, and QGIS for geographic visualizations. Data sources: ReferenceUSA (food markets) and CDC (health outcomes).
